Product Description: Tyrusha SmartHealth Band
Document Title: Tyrusha SmartHealth Band – Intelligent Wearable for Holistic Wellness

The Tyrusha SmartHealth Band is a cutting-edge wearable designed to help users manage their health, fitness, and daily habits with real-time insights. Equipped with AI-powered analytics, this band is more than a fitness tracker—it's a personal wellness coach.

Built using medical-grade sensors, the SmartHealth Band continuously monitors vital signs including heart rate variability (HRV), oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, sleep quality, and even hydration levels. With its 24/7 heart rhythm tracking, it can proactively detect anomalies and trigger alerts for early detection of health risks.

The device integrates seamlessly with the Tyrusha Health app, which offers personalized recommendations, trend reports, habit suggestions, and integration with electronic health records (EHR). Users receive AI-driven nudges like “You seem stressed today. Would you like to try a 3-minute breathing exercise?”

The Tyrusha Wellness Graph—an innovation powered by embedded GraphRAG technology—constructs a personalized knowledge graph for every user, capturing relationships between physical activity, mood, diet, and biometrics over time. This graph is continuously updated and queried by an intelligent agent to surface patterns like “High caffeine intake before 8 PM decreases deep sleep by 20%.”

Key features include:

Multi-dimensional Health Tracking (HR, SpO2, Skin Temp, Sleep)

Long Battery Life (15 days)

AI-Powered Habit Coach

Emergency Alert System

Open API for Developers

The product is especially useful for those managing chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) or undergoing remote patient monitoring. Tyrusha's AI models are trained on anonymized data to provide highly contextual feedback based on gender, age, fitness goals, and medical history.

In enterprise healthcare, the band is used by wellness providers to monitor populations at scale, detect early health deterioration signals, and offer preventive care interventions.

Tyrusha's mission is to build "Hyper-personalized, agent-driven wellness through structured health graphs." With privacy at its core, all personal health data is end-to-end encrypted and locally stored on the user’s device before syncing.
